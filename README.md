Make music using short code

At the link above, we get a cool video showing how to make music using short code and some strange algorithms. Clearly it is really hard to control the mainstream, but sometimes hazardously we can reach something more or less fun - captivating. I like this tiny code which can be embedded in a solid application because it uses an independant thread. Sometimes I created some background tracks for my little projects developed with my Pixel Game Engine Template. More than a curiosity - a pure code for noise. Have fun ++
