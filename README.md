Make music using short code

At the link above, we have a cool video showing how to make music using short code and some strange algorithms. Clearly it is really hard to control the main stream, but sometimes hazardously we can reach something more or less fun - captivating. I like this tiny code which can be embedded in a solid application because it uses an independant thread. Sometimes I have created some background tracks for my little projects developed with my Pixel Game Engine Template. More than a curiosity - a pure code for noise. Have fun ++

Recently I found a website about a fun contest using minimalist tools. One of them - create a music using short codes :

Bytebeat Music Competition. Create music with just simple logical formulas in 256 characters or less using short code :
